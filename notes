so the thing I'm trying to figure
out is how does render work?

basically we want to generate the 
entire DOM. off of our shadowDOM


so render is good 
it should like wrap the contents

so then there is things like innerHTML
ok so innerHTML literally only captures up to 
the first child node.
ok, then it's ok for it to be set.
it's always first
